# Self-Training Project

This project demonstrates the use of the Self-Training algorithm for semi-supervised learning. The script trains a Self-Training model on synthetic data and prints the accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self_training_project.git
    cd self_training_project
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the script to train the Self-Training model:
```sh
python self_training.py
